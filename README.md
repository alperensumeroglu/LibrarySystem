LibrarySystem - Library Management System
LibrarySystem is a Python-based application designed to help manage a library's operations efficiently. This system allows administrators to manage books, members, and track borrowing and returning activities. It also includes features for handling penalties for overdue returns and organizing books by categories.
Key Features:
Book Management: Add, remove, and update book information (e.g., title, author, genre, stock) with administrator privileges.
Member Management: Add and manage library members, including contact details.
Borrow and Return System: Track book loans and returns, with automatic stock updates.
Penalty System: Calculate and apply penalties for overdue book returns.
Category Search: Allows searching for books based on their category or genre.
